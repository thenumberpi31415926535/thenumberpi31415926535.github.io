# Points of discussion but not limited to:
- Are there any encounters that you experienced yourself? (or a story from your friend)
- Would you go to a haunted place ON A DARE?
- If you were a ghost who or what would you haunt?
- What are some superstitions in Taiwan?
- Would you follow the rituals out of respect even when it's not your beliefs?
