# Points of discussion but not limited to:
- What are the misdemeanors that has happened to you and your vehicle?
- Red light means stop, green light means go?  What are the rules people rarely follow? Or happily break?
- What are the most outrageous behavior you seen a driver / rider do?
- What are some traffic laws that you think makes no sense at all?
- Have you ever got into a road rage?
- Do you think self-driving cars will be ok in Taiwan's traffic?
