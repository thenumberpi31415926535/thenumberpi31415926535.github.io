Hosts gather up!  It's time to put your feet up and relax.  Come and catch up
with us.

It's been a successful month!  Apart from the weekly hosts, Jason, Bones and
myself, Uya and Milo are running beer night every Friday fortnightly.  Judy,
Momo, Ives and Duke have hosted a couple of sessions.  On top of that we had
Abby returning to us, as you can see, a catch up is long overdue!  I look forward
to catching up with you all.
