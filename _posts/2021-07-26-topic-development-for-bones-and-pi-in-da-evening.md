Bones and I have opened up our topic development sessions to the public.  

<!--more-->

Before each of our talk on Wednesdays, we often get together to do a retrospective on our last talk and to brainstorm our next topic.  We have a Miro broad where we collaborate ideas and develop our discussion for the upcoming talks. 

It is a great way to get an insight of what we do as hosts and how we work as a team.

We encourage people who wish to start a talk themselves to join us or simply join in to have your say on the topics we develop!

This week we have chosen our topic based on #polls in Discord.  Keep polling and tell us what you are keen to discuss!
