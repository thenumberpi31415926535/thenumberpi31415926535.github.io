Online English Learning Community is an non-for-profit community initiated by a number of people, aiming to bring hosts together to build an online English speaking environment.  We have different purpose and goals, but do have one thing in common, that is to facilitate talks online, help bring people together and spark conversations.

We have been hosting most of our information on a popular note taking service, that has been undergoing a few changes, rendering some of our event details unreachable.  I have started aggregating contents to an static website at [https://www.oelc.kolinchang.xyz](https://www.oelc.kolinchang.xyz/events.html). 

This site is a proof of concept - something I built in a leisure, which will update itself once a day.
