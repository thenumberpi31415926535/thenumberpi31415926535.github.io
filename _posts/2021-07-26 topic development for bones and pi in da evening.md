Bones and I has opened up our topic development sessions to the public.  

<!--more-->

Before each of our talk on Wednesday, we often get together to do a retrospective on our last talk and to brainstorm out next topic.  We have a miro broad where we collaborate ideas and develop our discussion for the next. 

It is a great way to get an insight as what we do as hosts and how we work as a team.

We encourage people who wish to start a talk themselves to join us or simply joining in to have your say on the topics we develop!

This week we have chosen our topic based on #polls in [[Discord]].  Keep polling and tell us what you want to discuss!
