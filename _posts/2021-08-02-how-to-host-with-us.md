title: How to host with us?
---

We value our hosts and we encourage collaboration.  Come and talk to us about
it.  You can reach me on my [Discord server]({{ site.author.discord}}).

We do have a format on going ahead.  That is for your participants to get to
know you before the event, and of course, the event.  

Talk to me to get started, you'll be offered a page to write down your
introduction which will be listed in [Get to know your hosts]({{ site.author.oelcHosts }}).

Once you have decided on the details of your event: 
1. Go to [Talks]({{ site.author.oelcCalendar }}).
1. Change the calendar to list view.  
1. Find an untitle event and fill in the details.

1. Click the Edit button to edit and fill in the details.
