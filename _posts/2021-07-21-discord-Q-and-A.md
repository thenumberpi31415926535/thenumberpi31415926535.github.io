Troubleshooting:
1. Should I be concerned with *"Un oh, you don't have webhook permissions in any
   server you're in.  Ask your server admin to give you the permission or ask
them to come follow themselves!"*?
Not at all, this error message will not affect you from signing up.

## Check your audio and mic settings ##
[Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

1. Go to your *USER SETTINGS* and location *Voice & Video* under *APP SETTINGS* on
your phone or PC.
For PC users: Locate *USER SETTINGS* on the bottom left of your app.  This is
what your bottom left corner looks like.

1. Ensure your *INPUT DEVICE* and *OUTPUT DEVICE* are correct.
1. It's also a good idea to conduct a *MIC TEST* using the sensitivity bar
   while you are here.
1. *INPUT MODE* should be set to _Voice Activity_, this will make it a much
   more relaxing experience. 
1. Fundamentally, above are the easy steps to follow when it comes to configure
   your discord setting inside the application.  However, it's possible that
the application, such as Discord, does not have permission to use your
microphone without your consent.  

Whether you are using an App on the phone or PC, it's important to grant
permission for Discord to use your Microphone in order to join our chat.  If
you are using a browser, I recommend using an app, otherwise, ensure you are
using something like Chrome and grant permission for Discord to use your
microphone.
