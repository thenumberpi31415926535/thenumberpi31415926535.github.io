title: 89793

Apart from occupying myself with aggregating data from Notion to a static website.  I have also been addicted in developing a Discord bot.  

Some of the functionalities include randomly popcorn users in a chat, going around naming every participants once randomly, or simply rolling a dice.  

89793 is an extension of myself, a continuation of 3.1415926535, but that's only for me to remember.  Next time you hop on my server, be sure to check out what it can do by issuing command *pi#help*.
