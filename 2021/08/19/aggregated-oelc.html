<p>We have been hosting most of our information on a popular note taking service, that has been undergoing a few changes, rendering some of our event details unreachable.  I have started aggregating contents to an static website at <a href="https://www.oelc.kolinchang.xyz/events.html">https://www.oelc.kolinchang.xyz</a>.</p>

<p>This site is a proof of concept - something I built in a leisure, which will update itself once a day.</p>
